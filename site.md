Overview of the website construction:

* Hosted by [Github Pages](https://www.pages.github.com/)
* Based on the [Moonwalk template](https://www.github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) by [Abhinav Saxena](https://www.abhinav.co/)
* Which both use [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com) to generate the site from separate template and content files, keeping styles consistent as the site grows.
* [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com)<i class="fa-solid fa-font-awesome"></i> supplies the many glyphs I'd never be able to draw myself
