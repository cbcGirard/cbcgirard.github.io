For quick circuit simulation, it's hard to beat Falstad's online simulator. You won't have all the features of a full SPICE simulator like [LTSpice](./ltspice.html), but beginners will probably need to pick up a lot of experience before they'd want to use them anyhow. Falstad's idealized components and built-in templates make it easy to visualize the inner workings of basic analog and digital circuits.
