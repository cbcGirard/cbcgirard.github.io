[SPICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE) and its descendants are the industry standard for simulating electronic circuits. Most of the proprietary offerings are *very* expensive, but Analog Devices (now owner of Linear Technology) offers LTspice for free. 

The interface is very... *retro*, but documentation is good and it comes with a large built-in library of components. Adding custom or third-party components is a bit inconvenient, but possible.

[KiCad](./kicad.html) has a SPICE simulator built in, but you will need to find your own models for components. Texas Instruments offers a free (but limited) version of [PSPICE](https://www.ti.com/tool/PSPICE-FOR-TI) with their components, but it's Windows-only.
