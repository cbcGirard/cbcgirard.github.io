There's still a *major* useability gap between open-source CAD platforms and their commercial counterparts. Much as I want to like [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org), I frequently can't find the right funcitonality for what I'm trying to do (and usually break the model in the process).

Though it's proprietary commercial software, Fusion is at least reasonably priced: no cost to students and hobbyists. You'll get both CAM and CAD in one package.

I can't comment on its electrical CAD capabilities, which cover schematic capture through PCB layout; I've been a longtime fan of [KiCAD](/faves/kicad.html) in that space, which has yet to give me a reason to try alternatives. Fusion's electrical modules seem to be based on the (former) hobbyist's favorite EAGLE, so I imagine it's a fine choice for a new user who already has a copy of Fusion at the ready.
