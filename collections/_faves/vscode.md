If you've used one of the 2.x versions of [the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc), this will look familiar because it shares a lot of [the same guts](https://www.theia-ide.org/). Unlike the Arduino IDE, VSCode is a general-purpose IDE with an extensive list of extensions, so it's suitable for pretty much any programming language. For web-development projects, some extensions let you preview how your site will look as you tweak it.

Another useful feature is the remote connection, where you can edit and run code on another machine. I had to run some compute-intensive simulations during an overseas trip, but could use a small laptop to control my beefier desktop back home when I had downtime at the hotel.
