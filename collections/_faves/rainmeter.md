Though far more powerful than I've ever taken advantage of&mdash;many have created entire custom desktops with the tool&mdash;Rainmeter has been fantastic for making some simple monitoring widgets I really wish were built into Windows. The [Performance Toolbar](/projects/performanceToolbar) gives a nice peek into the computer's operation (and whether that code you *thought* uses all the cores is actually taking advantage of them). For monitoring attached microcontrollers, [this COM port widget](/projects/comPortWidget) live-updates which devices are connected to the PC.
