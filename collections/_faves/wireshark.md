The learning curve is steep, as are most similarly-powerful tools, but it's hard to find a better option if you need to snoop on messages as they travel from point A to point B. Though network traffic is its primary focus, extensions let you also poke around Bluetooth and USB transmissions.

For simple monitoring of an active serial port (even if another program is using it), try my [Serial Snooper](https://github.com/cbcGirard/SerialSnooper) plugin. Great for checking in on an Arduino talking to another program, perhaps a [LabVIEW](./labview) interface.
