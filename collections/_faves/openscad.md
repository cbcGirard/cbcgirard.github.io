It's a quirky entry in the world of CAD, but it has its use cases. Like [LaTeX](/faves/latex) compared to Microsoft Word, OpenSCAD uses scripted input to later generate the final product, instead of the graphical [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) approach of most CAD packages.

With input parameters and geometric macros, the programmatic modeling makes it convenient to generate variants from a single design. Setting up said program will usually require more mathematical setup than a normal CAD package would require, but the result is easier to share and reuse by others than is possible with proprietary CAD software.

If anything, it's worth trying out in a hobby project, to get a different perspective on the modelling process.
