In addition to the [various UML diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) you'd expect it to support, PlantUML can generate other useful technical diagrams like [Gantt charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) from a text description.

It might feel weird to non-programmers, but the graphics-from-pseudocode workflow helps you focus on the content being presented, without worrying about how to construct the visualization itself, *a la* [LaTeX](./latex.html) or [Quarto](./quarto.html). There's lower risk of a typo hopelessly snarling the whole diagram, though, both because the requisite input is much briefer, and because the [online editor/generator](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml) regenerates the image seconds after you stop typing, so you'll spot your mistake immediately.
