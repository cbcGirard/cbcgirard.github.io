If you need higher horsepower than a standard Arduino can provide, Teensies are a great option. The boards might look relatively barebones, but historically they employ more advanced microcontrollers with faster clocks and features like floating-point acceleration, true analog output, and multiple processor cores.

Though the hardware has little in common with most other Arduino boards, they are still programmed through the same Arduino IDE, using the same libraries.
