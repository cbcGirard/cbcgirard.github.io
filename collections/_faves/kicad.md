Linux is probably the most successful open-source project, in terms of its scale, quality, and wide adoption. I think KiCad is on a similar trajectory, though in the much smaller niche of electronics CAD.

Commercial programs might look a bit nicer and have some extra bells and whistles, but KiCad offers everything needed to get to a quite sophisticated PCB. Circuit simulation is possible, but requires some legwork to find accurate models of specific components (unlike [LTSpice](./ltspice.html), which comes with a substantial library). However, KiCad's built-in libraries for schematic symbols, PCB footprints, and 3d component models are quite comprehensive; if you have an exotic part that's not already in them, you can recreate all but the 3d model easily in KiCad itself.

If your plans stop at drawing a basic schematic or simulating the circuit, [Falstad](./falstad.html) or [LTSpice](./ltspice.html) might get the job done with less learning curve.
