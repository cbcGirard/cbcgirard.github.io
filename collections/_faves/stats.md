I like to keep an eye on what's happening under the hood on my system, especially if I'm testing code with a lot of number-crunching involved. The Linux distros I've used (especially KDE) have nice toolbar widgets for showing the relevant metrics at-a-glance; [Rainmeter](./rainmeter.html) in conjunction with [HWiNFO](hwinfo.com) let me set something similar up for Windows.

Stats is arguably nicer-looking than the KDE widgets, and it's a lot easier to set up than Rainmeter too. It's still just as detailed and customizable, though.
