[GitHub](github.com) might be better known than Git itself, but it's just one tool built on the underlying software. Though Git makes it possible to synchronize multiple programmers (and their machines) within a single code base, it can also make your life easier by tracking changes within your own hard drive, in case you need to roll back a failed experiment (or three).

Git *does* have a bit of an [intimidating reputation](https://xkcd.com/1597/), but it's pretty well integrated into [VSCode](./vscode.html) and other IDEs nowadays. Expect little to no hoop-jumping for setup and basic use; if you *do* need to find the right command-line incantation to do something more exotic, Google will almost always have an answer for you to copy-paste.
