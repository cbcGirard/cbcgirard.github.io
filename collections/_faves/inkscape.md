Though it's often considered the "poor man's Illustrator," I actually prefer Inkscape's interface. Maybe it's just my years of experience from not paying Adobe, but Inkscape seems focused where Illustrator is needlessly bloated.

Admittedly, I spend way less time on artistic applications than I do technical ones. Inkscape will happily accept your scientific figures and CAD drawings, for any modifications or format-massaging you'd need between the original graphics and their final destination. Laser cutters often require a fair bit of pre-processing to actually understand where they're supposed to cut, a process that either requires a vector editor like Inkscape, or is far more convenient than the manufacturer's software.
