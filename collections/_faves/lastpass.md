Life is too short to remember a bunch of passwords. Reusing the same password for everything isn't an option, either; only one site needs to be compromised to potentially expose the rest. With a password manager, you still need to remember one solid password, but the manager then supplies unique, practically unguessable passwords for each site. A leak in one website won't threaten the others, and setting a new password takes a couple seconds and no new memorization.

Lastpass is one of many options in the space, both commercial and self-contained open-source software; personally, I don't see major advantages of any over the others, compared to the benefits of using *any* manager instead of manual memorization. That said, I've used Lastpass for years and it's been consistently convenient across multiple devices, inexpensive, and reliable. I also like its credential-sharing options, either for one-time emergency access or ongoing shared accounts.
