Yes, I realize how nerdy it is to have a favorite pen model. Particularly when it isn't some elegant fountain pen, but a generic ballpoint you can find pretty much anywhere pens are sold. When your handwriting is as bad as mine, though, you need all the help you can get to be vaguely legible. The ink flows effortlessly, and the tip is about as thin as you can get outside of more exotic offerings.

The only improvement I can think of would be faster-drying ink, to avoid smudges on less-receptive surfaces. Even with my toddler-level hand-eye coordination, it's still not an issue with most paper.
